An interactive AR diorama of Carleton University for iOS using Reality Composer and RealityKit. This app was built for my honours project at Carleton University during Fall 2019.

When a building is tapped, information about the building will display as an overlay view and a spinning arrow will point to the building that was selected.

## Project Abstract

From video games to online shopping, augmented reality is changing the way people interact with technology. During their WWDC conference in 2019, Apple released Reality Composer and the RealityKit framework, making it easier for developers to create convincing interactive virtual experiences that blend in seamlessly with the real world. This project explores the challenges and benefits of creating an AR experience for iOS using RealityKit and Reality Composer by creating an interactive diorama of the Carleton University campus.
